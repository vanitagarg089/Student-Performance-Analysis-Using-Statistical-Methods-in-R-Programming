# Student Performance Analysis Using Statistical Methods in R

This repository contains a mini-project focused on analyzing student performance using R. The project leverages real educational datasets from Kaggle/UCI ML Repository to explore how factors like study time, gender, and parental education influence math achievement.

## 🚀 Features
- Dataset preprocessing (cleaning, missing values, data types)
- Descriptive statistics and outlier detection
- Visualizations: histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, violin plots
- Correlation and regression analysis
- Multivariate comparison using faceted plots and parallel coordinates

## 📂 Contents
- `students_performance.csv` – dataset used for analysis  
- R scripts for EDA, visualization, and regression
- PDF/Report summarizing objectives, methods, results & conclusion

## ✅ Objective
To identify key factors affecting academic performance and provide insights that assist educators in data-driven decision-making.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- R
- ggplot2
- GGally
- dplyr

## 📊 Outcome
The analysis reveals score distributions, demographic performance gaps, and predictors of achievement, supporting better educational planning and student support strategies.
